Dear StreamSets,
<br><br>
My name is Edson and i’m a Frontend Web Developer.
<br><br>
My career has led me through a multitude of challenges and experiences.
<br><br>
On my work in UNR, I built Graphical Reports that would interpret neuron voltage data using D3js. I coded in things that were important to me as a user, like snappiness, and customizability.
<br><br>
At RDM, i’ve written software that would replace $3k barcode scanners that ran like a mule through mud. I emulated the design and wrote server protocols that would interface with legacy PICK databases; software that would speed up production and operation because the user experience was now sleeker, snappier and easier on the eyes.
<br><br>
<div id="border"></div>
<br><br>
On the next step in my career, I would love to work with StreamSets, and here's why: the user interface experience is important, and I want to continue my work in this domain. This means user experience workflow, the presentation of information, and data visualization. StreamSets deals with all of them, and I love working on all of them equally.
<br><br>
I understand that StreamSets deals with data visualization, but I would like to throw an idea on the table: In addition to understanding data, can it be useful for users to customize their viewing experience as well?
<br><br>
I dove into a miniature project to showcase this idea I had about system component visualization. What if the user were allowed to prioritize and segregate modules in visualization? In addition to presentation, can a user move things around so they can better understand what they’re seeing?
<br><br>
I first set out to mimick the original system visualization.
<br><br>
<div class="showcase_group">
	<div class="showcase_group_child group1"><img src="showcase1.jpg"></img></div>
	<div class="showcase_group_child group1"><img src="showcase2.jpg"></img></div>
</div>
<br><br>
In my project, I allowed the user to move modules around, so they can segregate systems by groups.
<br><br>
<div class="showcase_group">
	<div class="showcase_group_child group3"><img src="showcase5.jpg" style="width: 30%;"></img></div>
</div>
<br><br>
I also wanted to allow the user to plan, perhaps add hypothetical systems or intermediary’s.
<br><br>
Perhaps the user can add another layer with which to record data before that data proceeds to another system?
<br><br>
<div class="showcase_group">
	<div class="showcase_group_child group2"><img src="showcase3.jpg"></img></div>
</div>
<br><br>
Or brainstorm hypothetical modules and simulate possible use cases.
<br><br>
<div class="showcase_group">
	<div class="showcase_group_child group2"><img src="showcase4.jpg"></img></div>
</div>
<br><br>
I'm not well informed in the industry of systems visualization, but this project served as an idea I wanted to throw onto the table.
<br><br>
You can check out my project <a href="http://ealmachar.github.io/projects/systemtopology/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>, using SVG with D3js.
<br><br>
My website is also located <a href="http://ealmachar.github.io/" target="_blank">here</a> for other projects.
<br><br>
I enjoy Frontend. As I search for more opportunities and look for more cool projects to engage in, I want to find a job for me that will help me do what I enjoy doing.
<br><br>
Thank you for reading this letter.
<br><br>
Edson
